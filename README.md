A novel strategy of loop mimicry to discover mimics by overlaying all-Ala cyclo-organopeptides on loop targets and find hits by assessing goodness of fit.

## Usage

dataset
```python
scaffolds: SMILES strings of 86 rigid and cheap organic scaffolds mentioned in the paper.
cyclo-organopeptides: SMILES strings of 602 cyclo-organopeptides, comprised of Ala and organic fragments, catergorized by sequence length.
conformers: include a link to access generated conformers of 602 cyclo-organopeptides.
```
